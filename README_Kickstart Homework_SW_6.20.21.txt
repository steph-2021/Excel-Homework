KickStart My Chart Homework Questions
Due June 20, 2021


1)	Question: Give the provided data, what are the three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
Answer: 
A.	53% of the kickstart projects were successful and exceeded pledged goals as a result of several backers funding the projects. Backers primarily supported theater and music projects in the United States, as these industries made up 34% of the total successful projects. This is likely due to:
	Having a solid business/operating plan and the ability to adequately carry it out 
	Networking and creating an environment of trust and integrity for others to believe in the success of the project
B.	33% of kickstart projects failed as a result of the lack of funding and meeting pledged goals

2)	Question: What are some of the limitations of the dataset?

Answer: 
A.	Insight into full intent and purpose of kickstart project
B.	Environmental, demographic conditions that may have contributed to failed, canceled projects
C.	Why pledge requirements were not fulfilled for canceled, failed projects
	Who backers/donators were?
	How much were they supposed to give
	Why they didn’t meet funding requirements

3)	Question: What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Answer: 
A.	Graph that depicts funding pledges vs goals for all countries
B.	Comparison of kickstart deadlines compared to average donations
